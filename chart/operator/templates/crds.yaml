                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                              specified.
                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                              in any namespaces.
                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                secretName is the name of the secret used to terminate TLS traffic on
                                port 443. Field is left optional to allow TLS routing based on SNI
                                hostname alone. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the "Host"
                                header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination
                                and value of the "Host" header is used for routing.
